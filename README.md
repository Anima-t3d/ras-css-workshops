*Red Airship CSS Kickstarter* session.
In this session we will be addressing the following topics:
1. Adding CSS
2. Selectors
3. Background
4. Box Model
5. Padding
6. Margin
7. Display

It's ideal for people who are just starting out with CSS and those never fully grasping the basics like inline vs block elements. Or if you just would like experience learning new things using my FAVEâ„¢ (FunAlwaysVeryEducational) method. It's a workshop (So theory + practical) estimated to take 1 to 2 hours.

*Red Airship Layouting in CSS* workshop.
In this session we will be addressing the following topics:
1. Tables
2. Floats
3. Calc()
4. Positioning
5. Flexbox
6. Grid

This workshop will take 2hrs+ and will be fun, but you need to have understanding of the items discussed in the first workshop before attending this one.
